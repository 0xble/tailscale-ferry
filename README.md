Tailscale-first file sharing CLI. Publish files and directories as
preview-rich URLs scoped to your tailnet, authenticated with per-share
tokens.

## Use it to

- Share a draft markdown with your team. It opens as a polished article,
  not a download.
- Preview a PDF on your phone without an iCloud handoff. Tap, scroll, done.
- Post a CSV link in chat that opens sortable in the browser. No
  spreadsheet app required.

## Features

- Share files and directories as live or snapshot links
- Rich previews: markdown (GFM), code (highlight.js), CSV (Tabulator),
  PDF (pdf.js), images, audio, video
- HMAC-SHA256 token auth per share
- Directory listing with breadcrumb navigation
- Automatic share expiry and garbage collection
- Snapshot mode for point-in-time copies

## Usage

```sh
# Publish a file (starts daemon automatically)
ferry publish ~/Desktop/report.pdf

# Publish a directory
ferry publish ~/Projects/docs/

# Snapshot mode (point-in-time copy)
ferry publish --snapshot ~/Desktop/draft.md

# Custom expiry (default: 7d)
ferry publish --expires-in 24h ~/Desktop/notes.txt

# List active shares
ferry list

# Get a share by id
ferry get <id>

# Extend share expiry
ferry renew <id>

# Revoke a share by id or exact path
ferry unshare <target>

# Check daemon and Tailscale health
ferry doctor
```

## Architecture

`ferry` is the client CLI. `ferryd` is the background daemon that runs
three HTTP listeners.

```
                tailnet peer
                +-----------+
                |  browser  |
                +-----+-----+
                      |
                      v   port 39124
                +-----------+    reads from
                |  ferryd   |    ~/.local/state/ferry/
                |  daemon   |    + your filesystem
                +-----+-----+
                      ^
        127.0.0.1:39125 (admin API)
                      |
                +-----+-----+
                |   ferry   |    publish, list, unshare,
                |    CLI    |    renew, doctor
                +-----------+
```

- **Public** (tailnet IP, port 39124): preview and raw file endpoints
- **Loopback** (127.0.0.1, port 39124): same as public, for local access
- **Admin** (127.0.0.1, port 39125): share CRUD API used by the `ferry`
  client

State is stored in `~/.local/state/ferry/` with the HMAC secret in a
0600-mode file under a 0700-mode directory.
